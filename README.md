# Pricing & Revenue Leakage Analysis (Telco Churn)

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom subscription business to identify **revenue leakage** and the **highest-impact retention opportunities**.  
Using **Python, SQL-style analysis, and Power BI**, I explore churn drivers (contract type, tenure, billing method, add-on services) and translate findings into **actionable business recommendations**.

## Business Problem
Churn reduces recurring revenue and increases acquisition costs.  
The goal is to answer:
- Who is most likely to churn?
- What product/pricing signals indicate revenue leakage?
- Which interventions could reduce churn and protect revenue?

## Methodology
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning (Python)**
   - Validate types, missing values, duplicates
   - Prepare features for analysis
2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Churn rate breakdown by contract, tenure, charges, payment method, services
3. **SQL-Style Queries**
   - Business KPIs and cohort summaries
4. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Executive churn overview + key segments + revenue impact

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & EDA (pandas)
- KPI design (churn rate, ARPU proxy, retention segments)
- SQL thinking (grouping, joins concepts, aggregations)
- BI dashboard design (Power BI)
- Business storytelling & recommendations

## Repository Structure
