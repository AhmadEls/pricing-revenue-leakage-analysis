# Pricing & Revenue Leakage Analysis (Telco Churn)

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom subscription business to identify **revenue leakage**, **high-risk customer segments**, and **actionable retention opportunities**.

Using **Python, SQL-style analysis, and Power BI**, I investigate key churn drivers (tenure, pricing, contract type, payment behavior, and service features) and translate insights into **business-focused recommendations**.

The goal is not only to explain churn — but to highlight **where revenue is being lost and how it can be protected**.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – data modeling, DAX measures, dashboarding
- **Python** – Pandas, NumPy, exploratory data analysis
- **SQL** – analytical queries, churn metrics, aggregations
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and project organization

---

## Business Problem
Customer churn reduces recurring revenue and increases acquisition costs.

This analysis answers:
- Who is most likely to churn?
- What pricing or product signals indicate revenue leakage?
- Which actions could reduce churn and protect revenue?

---

## Key Insights
- **Early-tenure customers are the highest risk**  
  Churn is heavily concentrated among customers in their first year.

- **Higher monthly charges correlate with churn**  
  Suggesting pricing sensitivity and perceived value gaps.

- **Contract type strongly impacts retention**  
  Month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn than long-term contracts.

- **Payment behavior is a churn signal**  
  Electronic check users churn far more than customers using automatic payments.

- **Service bundles reduce churn**  
  Customers without technical support or online security churn nearly 3× more.

---

## High-Risk Customer Profile
Customers most likely to churn typically have:
- Short tenure
- Month-to-month contracts
- Above-average monthly charges
- No technical support or online security
- Manual or electronic payment methods

---

## Business Recommendations
- Strengthen **early customer onboarding**
- Incentivize migration to **long-term contracts**
- Bundle **technical support and security services**
- Promote **automatic payment methods**
- Reassess pricing for high-cost plans to ensure value alignment
